#Variables
- In C, variables are used to store and manipulate data. They need to be declared before they are used.

#if...else

-if...else statements allow conditional execution of code blocks based on certain conditions:
**iif (condition) {
    // Code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if condition is false
}
**

#while
- while loops repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true:
** while (condition) {
    // Code to execute while the condition is true
}
**
