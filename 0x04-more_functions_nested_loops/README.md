# C - More functions, more nested loops

The C programming language is quite flexible, allowing for the creation of various functions and nested loops to handle complex tasks efficiently. Functions help organize code by breaking it into smaller, manageable parts, while nested loops provide a way to perform iterative tasks within other iterative tasks.

Nested while loops can be powerful for handling repetitive tasks where you need to iterate through multiple sets of data or conditions. They involve using one or more while loops inside another while loop to achieve the desired outcome.

Functions in C allow you to modularize your code by breaking it into smaller, reusable parts. A function prototype serves as a declaration of the function before its actual implementation. It informs the compiler about the function's name, return type, and parameters it expects. This enables the compiler to understand how to call the function correctly even before its actual definition, allowing functions to be called in any order within a program.

Regarding header files in C, they contain function prototypes, global variable declarations, and macro definitions. They provide a way to share declarations between different source files. When you include a header file using the #include directive, it essentially pastes the contents of the header file into your code. This inclusion guards against multiple definitions using preprocessor directives like #ifndef, #define, and #endif.

The "Once-Only Headers" concept involves using conditional compilation directives to ensure that a header file is included only once in a source file. This is typically achieved by using constructs like:

```c
#ifndef HEADER_NAME_H
#define HEADER_NAME_H

// Header contents

#endif /* HEADER_NAME_H */
```

This prevents issues with multiple definitions when a header file is included in different parts of a program
